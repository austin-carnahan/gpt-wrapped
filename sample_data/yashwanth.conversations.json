It\u2019s not about stopping AI altogether, but ensuring it's developed and used responsibly. Here are the key strategies:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Robust AI Governance and Regulation**\n- **Global coordination**: Like climate change, AI risks are global. International agreements are needed (like the UN AI advisory body or OECD principles).\n- **Laws and oversight**: Enforceable rules on powerful AI models to ensure safety testing, transparency, and control over deployment.\n\n### 2. **Ethical AI Development**\n- **Alignment with human values**: Research into aligning AI goals with human well-being (e.g., through techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback).\n- **Bias and fairness**: Design AI systems that do not amplify discrimination or inequality.\n- **Transparency**: Open models or explainable AI can make systems more understandable and accountable.\n\n### 3. **Control Over Powerful AI**\n- **Pause or limit development of highly autonomous AI** until we can ensure safety (as some have proposed for AGI or superintelligence).\n- **Kill switches / containment**: Build in emergency shutdown procedures, sandboxing, or restricted access to critical systems.\n\n### 4. **Reduce Environmental Impact**\n- **Green AI**: Use efficient models and data centers to reduce carbon emissions from AI training and deployment.\n- **AI for sustainability**: Focus on using AI to solve environmental issues\u2014like optimizing energy use, monitoring deforestation, and improving agriculture.\n\n### 5. **Public Awareness and Advocacy**\n- **Educate citizens and leaders** about AI risks and benefits.\n- **Demand accountability** from tech companies and governments through public pressure, voting, and consumer choices.\n\n### 6. **Limit Military AI**\n- Advocate for international treaties to ban autonomous weapons and prevent an AI arms race.\n\n---\n\nUltimately, the goal is to **make AI a tool for good**, not a threat. That requires effort from engineers, policymakers, researchers, and regular citizens working together.\n\nWould you like a visual or short infographic summarizing these points?"]}, "status":

bandwidth with low latency** and **low bandwidth with high latency**.\n\nIn the first graph titled *\"Loss rate over time (high_bw_low_lat)\"*, we observe that all three algorithms\u2014Cubic, BBR, and Vegas\u2014experience a brief initial burst of packet loss at the very beginning of the test (around time 0 seconds), with **Vegas** showing the highest initial loss rate, peaking above 5%. However, immediately after this spike, the loss rate for all algorithms drops sharply to **0%** and remains there for the rest of the measurement period (up to approximately 1300 seconds). This behavior suggests that all three congestion control algorithms are capable of quickly adapting to the favorable network conditions (high bandwidth and low latency), stabilizing the data flow and preventing further packet loss after the initial adjustment phase.\n\nIn contrast, the second graph titled *\"Loss rate over time (low_bw_high_lat)\"* shows a significantly different behavior due to the challenging network conditions (low bandwidth and high latency). Here, all three algorithms again experience packet loss in the early phase of the transmission (between 0.2 to 0.7 seconds), with **Cubic** having the highest loss rate initially (slightly above 0.07%), followed closely by BBR and Vegas. However, just like in the first graph, the loss rate quickly drops to **0%** for all three algorithms and remains stable thereafter. This indicates that even under constrained network environments, these congestion control mechanisms are able to adapt quickly and eliminate further loss once they have calibrated to the available capacity.\n\nIn summary, both graphs demonstrate that **Cubic**, **BBR**, and **Vegas** experience an initial loss period when the flow starts\u2014likely due to overshooting available bandwidth or slow-start mechanisms\u2014but rapidly adjust their transmission rates to stabilize. The difference in the magnitude and duration of the initial loss reflects the varying sensitivity of these algorithms to the underlying network characteristics.

Vegas exhibits the highest initial loss, rising above 5%, while BBR and Cubic follow with slightly lower peaks. This early burst of loss is likely due to aggressive initial probing for available bandwidth, which briefly overwhelms the network. However, this spike is short-lived. The algorithms quickly adapt, and the loss rate drops to zero almost instantly, remaining at that level for the rest of the observed period. This rapid convergence to stable behavior indicates that the algorithms are well-tuned to handle ideal conditions, efficiently utilizing available resources without causing ongoing congestion.\n\nOn the other hand, in a low bandwidth and high latency environment, the initial loss rates for all three algorithms are much lower in magnitude, peaking below 0.08%. Cubic experiences the highest among them, with BBR and Vegas showing slightly better control. This suggests a more conservative start in constrained environments. Despite the lower loss rates, the pattern is similar: a quick adjustment phase within the first half-second, after which the loss rate stabilizes at zero. This implies that even in less favorable network conditions, the congestion control mechanisms are effective in moderating their transmission rates to prevent sustained packet loss after the initial adjustment.\n\nOverall, the results demonstrate that while all three algorithms experience brief startup loss in both scenarios, they are robust in adapting to both optimal and constrained network conditions, with only minor differences in how aggressively they initially probe for bandwidth."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "citations": [], "content_references": [], "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "parent_id": "f29c68a0-06a0-4cd1-b2cb-d27d947e6072", "request_id": "932a056abea21840-STL", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "f29c68a0-06a0-4cd1-b2cb-d27d947e6072", "children": ["d701fcbc-e97b-4361-8d65-40b2a124e709"]}, "d701fcbc-e97b-4361-8d65-40b2a124e709": {"id": "d701fcbc-e97b-4361-8d65-40b2a124e709", "message": {"id": "d701fcbc-e97b-4361-8d65-40b2a124e709", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1745041580.512, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "multimodal_text", "parts": [{"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-RaoQwQ5gJcUi9SXRkJT6b4", "size_bytes": 30906, "width": 1048, "height": 588, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}, {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-YT5jfpMJHgeJTYUUJGK2ES", "size_bytes": 29357, "width": 1048, "height": 588, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}, {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-Uz4zPey1Rg85XKRfFYgJ9f", "size_bytes": 26521, "width": 1030, "height": 588, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}, "explain these images"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"id": "file-RaoQwQ5gJcUi9SXRkJT6b4", "size": 30906, "name": "bbr_datalink_delay_run1.png", "mime_type": "image/png", "width": 1048, "height": 588}, {"id": "file-YT5jfpMJHgeJTYUUJGK2ES", "size": 29357, "name": "cubic_datalink_delay_run1.png", "mime_type": "image/png", "width": 1048, "height": 588}, {"id": "file-Uz4zPey1Rg85XKRfFYgJ9f", "size": 26521, "name": "vegas_datalink_delay_run1.png", "mime_type": "image/png", "width": 1030, "height": 588}], "serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "932a19d65faadd90-STL", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "69971109-0cd2-4bd9-9c14-0f2241398e6d", "children": ["81158860-9890-4745-bdd9-7df68a81c622"]}, "81158860-9890-4745-bdd9-7df68a81c622": {"id": "81158860-9890-4745-bdd9-7df68a81c622", "message": {"id": "81158860-9890-4745-bdd9-7df68a81c622", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1745041581.606843, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["These three graphs display **per-packet one-way delay over time** for a network flow under different TCP congestion control algorithms: **BBR**, **Cubic**, and **Vegas**. The vertical axis shows the one-way delay in milliseconds (ms), while the horizontal axis indicates time in seconds (s). Each dot represents the delay experienced by an individual packet.\n\n---\n\n### BBR Delay Behavior\n\nThe first graph shows the behavior of **BBR**. The delay increases **steadily and linearly** throughout the duration of the flow, reaching a **95th percentile delay of approximately 16,000 ms**. This indicates that BBR consistently injects more packets into the network without sufficiently backing off, leading to significant queuing delays. BBR aims to operate near the bandwidth-delay product, but in this scenario, it likely overestimates the available bandwidth, causing queue buildup and consequently high one-way delay.\n\n---\n\n### Cubic Delay Behavior\n\nThe second graph represents **Cubic**. It follows a **very similar trend to BBR**, with steadily increasing delays and a final 95th percentile delay also close to 16,000 ms. Like BBR, Cubic does not adapt quickly enough to prevent persistent queuing, which means that it too contributes to growing latency over time. While Cubic's congestion window grows aggressively, it doesn't react fast enough to delay signals, leading to similar excessive queuing delays.\n\n---\n\n### Vegas Delay Behavior\n\nThe third graph shows the delay performance under **Vegas**, which stands in stark contrast to BBR and Cubic. Vegas maintains a **very stable and low delay**, with the 95th percentile hovering around **486 ms**. The delay remains nearly flat across time, showing that Vegas is highly effective at keeping queues short. This is because Vegas uses **delay-based congestion detection**, which allows it to sense early congestion and back off before significant queuing occurs. As a result, it achieves much better delay performance, which is ideal for latency-sensitive applications.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **BBR and Cubic** both result in substantial queue buildup, causing severe latency increases (up to 16 seconds).\n- **Vegas**, on the other hand, is far more efficient in managing queue lengths and preserving low latency (under 500 ms).\n- The key difference lies in how each algorithm detects and responds to congestion: **loss-based (Cubic)** and **model-based (BBR)** are more aggressive, while **delay-based (Vegas)** is conservative but stable.\n\nThis makes Vegas an excellent choice for real-time or interactive applications, while BBR and Cubic may be more suitable in scenarios where throughput is more critical than delay."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "citations": [], "content_references": [], "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "parent_id": "d701fcbc-e97b-4361-8d65-40b2a124e709", "request_id": "932a19d65faadd90-STL", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "d701fcbc-e97b-4361-8d65-40b2a124e709", "children": ["b1a6b5d2-a90a-43f3-8f07-6f1bf48707cb"]}, "b1a6b5d2-a90a-43f3-8f07-6f1bf48707cb": {"id": "b1a6b5d2-a90a-43f3-8f07-6f1bf48707cb", "message": {"id": "b1a6b5d2-a90a-43f3-8f07-6f1bf48707cb", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1745041864.191, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "multimodal_text", "parts": [{"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-EZowkZRMfgUcSNF2oVBMUF", "size_bytes": 26521, "width": 1030, "height": 588, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}, {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-74vBJ6JzJkk2X93yVHFRKQ", "size_bytes": 26310, "width": 1030, "height": 588, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}, {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-5Si1Y5YtuamQHErRfh5hZK", "size_bytes": 26319, "width": 1030, "height": 588, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}, "help me with explanation"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"id": "file-EZowkZRMfgUcSNF2oVBMUF", "size": 26521, "name": "vegas_datalink_delay_run1.png", "mime_type": "image/png", "width": 1030, "height": 588}, {"id": "file-74vBJ6JzJkk2X93yVHFRKQ", "size": 26310, "name": "cubic_datalink_delay_run1.png", "mime_type": "image/png", "width": 1030, "height": 588}, {"id": "file-5Si1Y5YtuamQHErRfh5hZK", "size": 26319, "name": "bbr_datalink_delay_run1.png", "mime_type": "image/png", "width": 1030, "height": 588}], "serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "932a20c35e71183a-STL", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "81158860-9890-4745-bdd9-7df68a81c622", "children": ["71da5f56-3d1e-487f-8c90-ddfff1621e70"]}, "71da5f56-3d1e-487f-8c90-ddfff1621e70": {"id": "71da5f56-3d1e-487f-8c90-ddfff1621e70", "message": {"id": "71da5f56-3d1e-487f-8c90-ddfff1621e70", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1745041865.11554, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Thanks for uploading the graphs!

Each algorithm displays distinct delay behavior that reflects its underlying congestion control strategy.\n\nThe BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) algorithm maintains very consistent delay measurements, with most values hovering just below 480 milliseconds. There is a single noticeable outlier at around 320 milliseconds, which may represent an early packet during the connection setup or a brief moment of under-utilization. The 95th percentile delay for BBR is 486.09 milliseconds, indicating that almost all packets experience very similar delay values. This aligns with BBR\u2019s design goal of operating at the estimated bottleneck bandwidth while keeping queues minimal, resulting in low delay variation and steady network behavior.\n\nIn contrast, the CUBIC algorithm shows more variability in delay. While most packet delays are still clustered near 475 to 480 milliseconds, there are several outliers with significantly lower delays, some dropping below 200 milliseconds. The 95th percentile delay for CUBIC is slightly lower at 483.17 milliseconds, but the overall pattern reveals a more bursty and inconsistent delay profile. This is typical of loss-based algorithms like CUBIC, which tend to build queues and then reduce sending rates in response to packet loss, leading to higher jitter and variable queuing delay.\n\nVegas, a delay-based algorithm, demonstrates a behavior very similar to BBR in this test. It maintains stable delay values, with most packet delays falling in the same 475\u2013480 millisecond range and a single lower outlier around 320 milliseconds. The 95th percentile delay for Vegas is 485.67 milliseconds. As a delay-based algorithm, Vegas aims to prevent queues from forming by adjusting its sending rate when it detects increased delay. This leads to low queuing and consistent performance, which is evident in the graph.\n\nIn summary, BBR and Vegas both provide highly stable delay performance with minimal variation, while CUBIC exhibits more fluctuation due to its reactive nature. Although CUBIC has a slightly lower 95th percentile delay, the increased variability might not be ideal for latency-sensitive applications. BBR and Vegas, on the other hand, deliver more predictable performance, making them better suited for scenarios where low and stable latency is important."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "citations": [], "content_references": [], "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "parent_id": "78fbe61c-a44d-4aee-8ac7-97cbe0eb0427", "request_id": "932a21356c0c183a-STL", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "78fbe61c-a44d-4aee-8ac7-97cbe0eb0427", "children": ["988c1f74-2e2d-45f5-9190-2d6274349dea"]}, "988c1f74-2e2d-45f5-9190-2d6274349dea": {"id": "988c1f74-2e2d-45f5-9190-2d6274349dea", "message": {"id": "988c1f74-2e2d-45f5-9190-2d6274349dea", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1745042389.867, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "multimodal_text", "parts": [{"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-Pq7JyhgaaQQzvhj9oPBRZx", "size_bytes": 26481, "width": 640, "height": 480, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}, {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-PQe6v5vcGyzDJGHvRDnimH", "size_bytes": 22347, "width": 640, "height": 480, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}, ""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"id": "file-Pq7JyhgaaQQzvhj9oPBRZx", "size": 26481, "name": "low_bw_high_lat_scatter.png", "mime_type": "image/png", "width": 640, "height": 480}, {"id": "file-PQe6v5vcGyzDJGHvRDnimH", "size": 22347, "name": "high_bw_low_lat_scatter.png", "mime_type": "image/png", "width": 640, "height": 480}], "serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "932a2d98b9d8dd95-STL", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "6cc88b3f-2086-4314-bd4d-9445264ff09a", "children": ["64b47c11-9d11-4424-b8ed-ad20bc7ef228"]}, "64b47c11-9d11-4424-b8ed-ad20bc7ef228": {"id": "64b47c11-9d11-4424-b8ed-ad20bc7ef228", "message": {"id": "64b47c11-9d11-4424-b8ed-ad20bc7ef228", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1745042390.725016, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Based on the provided visualizations, we can observe and compare the performance of three TCP congestion control algorithms\u2014BBR, CUBIC, and Vegas\u2014under different network conditions in terms of one-way delay and throughput vs. round-trip time (RTT).\n\nIn the **delay graphs**, BBR and Vegas show similar patterns in terms of per-packet one-way delay, with most delays hovering close to the 475 ms mark and both having a 95th percentile delay around 486 ms. CUBIC, on the other hand, demonstrates greater variability in delay, with occasional sharp drops below 300 ms. Interestingly, despite this fluctuation, its 95th percentile delay (483.17 ms) remains comparable to BBR and Vegas. This suggests that while CUBIC may introduce more jitter or inconsistency in packet delivery times, it still maintains relatively high peak performance with regard to latency.\n\nTurning to the **throughput vs. RTT scatter plots**, the performance varies with the network environment. Under **low bandwidth, high latency** conditions, CUBIC achieves the highest average throughput (~0.076 Mbps) but also has the highest RTT. BBR performs slightly below CUBIC in throughput (~0.07475 Mbps) but maintains the lowest RTT, indicating it achieves a good balance between speed and delay. Vegas, however, lags behind both in throughput (~0.074 Mbps), though it has a moderate RTT between the two. This suggests that in such constrained environments, BBR is efficient in keeping delay low without sacrificing much throughput.\n\nUnder **high bandwidth, low latency** conditions, BBR again outperforms both CUBIC and Vegas in throughput (~0.318 Mbps), and also maintains the lowest RTT. CUBIC trails in both metrics, while Vegas, interestingly, has slightly better throughput than CUBIC (~0.312 Mbps vs. ~0.309 Mbps) but at the cost of a slightly higher RTT.\n\nOverall, BBR consistently shows strong performance across different conditions, offering low delay and high throughput.

Difference between BBR and cubic :\n\n \n\nPart C: Data Analysis and Consideration\n1. Throughput, Loss, RTT Comparison\nA.\t Ramp-Up Behavior \u2013 Throughput:\na.  Low_bw_high_lat_throughput:\n\n In the low bandwidth, high latency scenario, the throughput of all three congestion control algorithms\u2014Cubic, BBR, and Vegas\u2014increases gradually, peaking around 0.65 seconds before slightly dipping and stabilizing. BBR and Cubic outperform Vegas, achieving slightly higher throughput levels, with BBR leading marginally. This is expected, as Vegas, being a delay-based algorithm, reacts conservatively to early signs of congestion (increased delay), resulting in lower throughput. In contrast, Cubic and BBR, which are loss-based and model-based respectively, are more aggressive in utilizing available bandwidth, making them more effective under high-latency conditions. The small dip observed post-peak may be due to buffer overflows or congestion signals causing a temporary back-off. \n\n \n b. high_bw_low_lat_throughput:\n\n In the high bandwidth, low latency scenario, all three algorithms show a sharp spike in throughput at the start, reaching nearly 1.8 Mbps, followed by a rapid decline and gradual stabilization. This pattern indicates that the algorithms initially probe the network aggressively, overshooting the sustainable rate, which then gets corrected by congestion control mechanisms. Over time, Cubic, BBR, and Vegas converge to similar throughput levels, suggesting that under optimal network conditions, the performance differences between these algorithms become negligible. The high initial burst and subsequent decay reflect efficient responsiveness but also highlight the importance of quickly adapting to available bandwidth. Overall, BBR and Cubic show stronger performance in constrained environments, while in high-performance networks, all three protocols behave comparably.\n\n \n\nBBR consistently ramped up faster and held steady throughput. Vegas was slow and stable, Cubic was aggressive but often fluctuated.\n\nB.\t Loss Time-Series:\n\n a. high_bw_low_lat_loss: Under high bandwidth and low latency conditions, all three congestion control algorithms experience an immediate and sharp spike in packet loss at the very beginning of the transmission. Vegas exhibits the highest initial loss, rising above 5%, while BBR and Cubic follow with slightly lower peaks. This early burst of loss is likely due to aggressive initial probing for available bandwidth, which briefly overwhelms the network. However, this spike is short-lived. The algorithms quickly adapt, and the loss rate drops to zero almost instantly, remaining at that level for the rest of the observed period. This rapid convergence to stable behavior indicates that the algorithms are well-tuned to handle ideal conditions, efficiently utilizing available resources without causing ongoing congestion.\n\n \n\nb. low_bw_high_lat_loss: Low bandwidth and high latency environment, the initial loss rates for all three algorithms are much lower in magnitude, peaking below 0.08%. Cubic experiences the highest among them, with BBR and Vegas showing slightly better control. This suggests a more conservative start in constrained environments. Despite the lower loss rates, the pattern is similar: a quick adjustment phase within the first half-second, after which the loss rate stabilizes at zero. This implies that even in less favorable network conditions, the congestion control mechanisms are effective in moderating their transmission rates to prevent sustained packet loss after the initial adjustment\n\n \nOverall, the results demonstrate that while all three algorithms experience brief startup loss in both scenarios, they are robust in adapting to both optimal and constrained network conditions, with only minor differences in how aggressively they initially probe for bandwidth. Loss increased sharply in constrained bandwidth. Cubic had more losses.\n\nC.\t RTT Analysis:\na.  Delay plots (bbr_datalink_delay_run1): The BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) algorithm maintains very consistent delay measurements, with most values hovering just below 480 milliseconds. There is a single noticeable outlier at around 320 milliseconds, which may represent an early packet during the connection setup or a moment of under-utilization. The 95th percentile delay for BBR is 486.09 milliseconds, indicating that almost all packets experience very similar delay values. This aligns with BBR\u2019s design goal of operating at the estimated bottleneck bandwidth while keeping queues minimal, resulting in low delay variation and steady network behavior.\n\n \n\nb. cubic_datalink_delay_run1: The cubic algorithm shows more variability in delay. While most packet delays are still clustered near 475 to 480 milliseconds, there are several outliers with significantly lower delays, some dropping below 200 milliseconds. The 95th percentile delay for CUBIC is slightly lower at 483.17 milliseconds, but the overall pattern reveals a more bursty and inconsistent delay profile. This is typical of loss-based algorithms like CUBIC, which tend to build queues and then reduce sending rates in response to packet loss, leading to higher jitter and variable queuing delay.\n\n \n\nc. vegas_datalink_delay_run1: Vegas, a delay-based algorithm, demonstrates a behavior very similar to BBR in this test. It maintains stable delay values, with most packet delays falling in the same 475\u2013480 millisecond range and a single lower outlier around 320 milliseconds. The 95th percentile delay for Vegas is 485.67 milliseconds. As a delay-based algorithm, Vegas aims to prevent queues from forming by adjusting its sending rate when it detects increased delay. This leads to low queuing and consistent performance, which is evident in the graph.\n \n\nBBR and Vegas both provide highly stable delay performance with minimal variation, while CUBIC exhibits more fluctuation due to its reactive nature. Although CUBIC has a slightly lower 95th percentile delay, the increased variability might not be ideal for latency-sensitive applications. BBR and Vegas, on the other hand, deliver more predictable performance, making them better suited for scenarios where low and stable latency is important.\n\nD.  RTT vs Throughput Scatter Plots:\n\n     a. high_bw_low_lat_scatter: Turning to the throughput vs. RTT scatter plots, the performance varies with the network environment. Under low bandwidth, high latency conditions, CUBIC achieves the highest average throughput (~0.076 Mbps) but also has the highest RTT. BBR performs slightly below CUBIC in throughput (~0.07475 Mbps) but maintains the lowest RTT, indicating it achieves a good balance between speed and delay. Vegas, however, lags both in throughput (~0.074 Mbps), though it has a moderate RTT between the two. This suggests that in such constrained environments, BBR is efficient in keeping delay low without sacrificing much throughput.\n\n \n\nb. low_bw_high_lat_scatter: Under high bandwidth, low latency conditions, BBR again outperforms both CUBIC and Vegas in throughput (~0.318 Mbps), and also maintains the lowest RTT. CUBIC trails in both metrics, while Vegas, interestingly, has slightly better throughput than CUBIC (~0.312 Mbps vs. ~0.309 Mbps) but at the cost of a slightly higher RTT. \n\n \n\nOverall, BBR consistently shows strong performance across different conditions, offering low delay and high throughput. CUBIC tends to prioritize throughput, sometimes at the cost of delay consistency, while Vegas is more conservative, favoring stable RTTs but often falling behind in throughput.\n\n2.

BBR consistently demonstrated superior performance in both high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth environments, offering a balanced trade-off between throughput and latency. Cubic, while achieving high throughput in constrained scenarios, struggled with increased delay and packet loss due to its aggressive nature. Vegas maintained stable delays but underperformed in throughput, highlighting its conservative design. These results underline the importance of selecting congestion control protocols based on specific network requirements\u2014where latency-sensitive applications might benefit more from Vegas or BBR, while throughput-focused scenarios might lean toward Cubic or BBR.

Here's the explanation split into two clear paragraphs:\n\n---\n\nIn this experiment, we analyzed the behavior of the BBR congestion control algorithm on a datalink with a very limited capacity of 0.01 Mbit/s. The delay graph shows a consistent and sharp increase in per-packet one-way delay over time, suggesting severe bufferbloat. This happens because BBR continues to send packets based on its bandwidth estimation, which in this constrained environment leads to persistent queuing. Since the bottleneck link cannot drain packets as fast as they arrive, the queue builds up, causing rising delays and inefficient delivery.\n\nThe throughput graph provides further insight into this behavior. While the ingress throughput frequently spikes above the available capacity, the egress throughput remains limited to around 0.01 Mbit/s, matching the physical link capacity. This indicates that BBR is injecting more data into the network than it can handle, and the excess packets are being queued. As a result, although BBR is designed to probe for available bandwidth, in this low-capacity scenario it fails to adapt properly, leading to congestion and poor performance. These results demonstrate the limitations of BBR in extremely bandwidth-constrained networks.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to add any observations or tweak the tone!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "citations": [], "content_references": [], "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "parent_id": "640969b1-13b2-44f5-aa02-e8fbb3878910", "request_id": "932a4d432d33dd95-STL", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "640969b1-13b2-44f5-aa02-e8fbb3878910", "children": []}, "30d202a2-75f0-49a5-9436-31cf574f7f7a": {"id": "30d202a2-75f0-49a5-9436-31cf574f7f7a", "message": {"id": "30d202a2-75f0-49a5-9436-31cf574f7f7a", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1745043716.059, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["in 2 different paragraphs pls according to the graphs\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "932a4dfaf883dd95-STL", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "85075a2f-6988-46ed-ad5d-7c34de31ad04", "children": ["a4bef7a4-9877-4269-913c-3bd513473bb5"]}, "a4bef7a4-9877-4269-913c-3bd513473bb5": {"id": "a4bef7a4-9877-4269-913c-3bd513473bb5", "message": {"id": "a4bef7a4-9877-4269-913c-3bd513473bb5", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1745043717.115665, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Of course! Here's a version with two separate paragraphs, each corresponding to one of the graphs:\n\n---\n\nThe first graph illustrates the per-packet one-way delay over time for a flow using the BBR congestion control algorithm. The delay increases almost linearly, reaching up to approximately 16,999 ms by the end of the experiment. This trend indicates persistent queuing delay, likely caused by BBR continuously sending data without detecting or reacting appropriately to the actual congestion in the network. The steady growth in delay suggests that the sender's queue is constantly building up, leading to severe bufferbloat. This behavior reveals a potential weakness of BBR in environments with limited bandwidth, where it may overestimate the bottleneck bandwidth and continue transmitting aggressively.\n\nThe second graph presents the throughput behavior of the same flow. The ingress throughput (data sent) fluctuates sharply and frequently spikes above the link's average capacity of 0.01 Mbit/s, while the egress throughput (data received) remains fairly steady and limited to around 0.01 Mbit/s. This discrepancy shows that although BBR is attempting to send more data, the bottleneck link cannot accommodate the excess traffic, causing queues to form and delays to rise. The bursty pattern in the ingress throughput also reflects BBR's probing behavior, where it periodically sends at higher rates to estimate bandwidth, but this results in inefficient link utilization under such constrained conditions.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to make this more detailed or add citations if you're including this in a report or paper!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "citations": [], "content_references": [], "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "parent_id": "30d202a2-75f0-49a5-9436-31cf574f7f7a", "request_id": "932a4dfaf883dd95-STL", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "30d202a2-75f0-49a5-9436-31cf574f7f7a", "children": ["d5945638-20db-4926-a108-07ecea1a57d6"]}, "d5945638-20db-4926-a108-07ecea1a57d6": {"id": "d5945638-20db-4926-a108-07ecea1a57d6", "message": {"id": "d5945638-20db-4926-a108-07ecea1a57d6", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1745043750.547, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["don't say like first or second graphs"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "932a4ed109f7dd95-STL", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "a4bef7a4-9877-4269-913c-3bd513473bb5", "children": ["d75b15a5-8b45-4a01-bac2-4dd081d37b6c"]}, "d75b15a5-8b45-4a01-bac2-4dd081d37b6c": {"id": "d75b15a5-8b45-4a01-bac2-4dd081d37b6c", "message": {"id": "d75b15a5-8b45-4a01-bac2-4dd081d37b6c", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1745043751.266376, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The per-packet one-way delay increases steadily over time, reaching a 95th percentile delay of nearly 16 seconds.

Here's the explanation based on the actual plot names:\n\nThe **`bbr_datalink_delay_run1.png`** plot illustrates a steadily increasing per-packet one-way delay over time, with the delay reaching up to approximately 16,999 milliseconds at the 95th percentile. This trend suggests that the BBR congestion control algorithm is injecting packets faster than the bottleneck link can handle, causing persistent queuing delays. The delay does not appear to stabilize throughout the measurement period, which implies bufferbloat is occurring \u2014 where packets accumulate in the queue, leading to increasingly higher delays and inefficient transmission, especially problematic in low-capacity links.\n\nThe **`bbr_datalink_throughput_run1.png`** plot shows the throughput behavior of the same flow. The ingress throughput (dashed line) frequently spikes, sometimes well above the average link capacity, whereas the egress throughput (solid line) remains low and relatively steady. The average ingress rate is 0.02 Mbit/s, while the egress rate averages only 0.01 Mbit/s, which matches the link\u2019s actual capacity. This disparity reflects that BBR is aggressively probing for more bandwidth than is available, leading to packet buildup in buffers without a corresponding increase in actual delivery rate, which confirms the inefficient use of available bandwidth in this low-throughput environment."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "citations": [], "content_references": [], "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "parent_id": "35c6117e-a606-45b2-9c3e-df54578ec821", "request_id": "932a50162c11dd95-STL", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "35c6117e-a606-45b2-9c3e-df54578ec821", "children": ["6c02b38c-a003-4c52-84db-9ad035c5b414"]}, "6c02b38c-a003-4c52-84db-9ad035c5b414": {"id": "6c02b38c-a003-4c52-84db-9ad035c5b414", "message": {"id": "6c02b38c-a003-4c52-84db-9ad035c5b414", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1745043945.294, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "multimodal_text", "parts": [{"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-NnDFxHFCpMbHGLoXSj6kuR", "size_bytes": 38863, "width": 936, "height": 526, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}, {"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-PfeM64jKGBQeR99TzWSVfa", "size_bytes": 107683, "width": 936, "height": 548, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "generation": null, "container_pixel_height": null, "container_pixel_width": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true, "asset_pointer_link": null, "watermarked_asset_pointer": null}}, ""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"id": "file-NnDFxHFCpMbHGLoXSj6kuR", "size": 38863, "name": "55871b38-bb60-4739-a814-eecd5c845cd9.png", "mime_type": "image/png", "width": 936, "height": 526}, {"id": "file-PfeM64jKGBQeR99TzWSVfa", "size": 107683, "name": "c9609e5a-6570-4161-8898-e03c42615cf9.png", "mime_type": "image/png", "width": 936, "height": 548}], "serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "932a53923abbdd95-STL", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "ea58cd5c-51a0-4a46-9f88-151d0ed81b47", "children": ["f4df2510-60c4-4761-a24a-3e05a21bf638"]}, "f4df2510-60c4-4761-a24a-3e05a21bf638": {"id": "f4df2510-60c4-4761-a24a-3e05a21bf638", "message": {"id": "f4df2510-60c4-4761-a24a-3e05a21bf638", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1745043946.43573, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["In the plot titled **\"Per-packet one-way delay (ms)\"**, we observe a consistent increase in delay over time.
